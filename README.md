## ToyBlockFactory
The toy block factory takes an order from a customer and generates an invoice detailing the amount of blocks (square, triangle, circle) and colours (red, blue, yellow) ordered and the cost of each.  A cutting report is generated for the cutting department and a painting report is generated for the paint department.
